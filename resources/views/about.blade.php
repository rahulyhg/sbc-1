					 <h1>About the Summer Body Club program</h1>
				 </div>
		 
				 <div class="nav_content1">
					 <p>The Summer Body Club is a unique weight loss program created by the team that has helped millions of people lose millions of pounds. Our 9-question quiz helps you determine which “Summer Body type” you are, and then gives you a plan that can help you meet your goals once and for all. Finally, a weight loss program that looks at the whole person, rather than just the number on the scale!</p>
<p>The “Navigator" plan is structured and clear; it's designed for people who are more likely to succeed if they know exactly what they need to do and eat every single day. The “Adventurer” plan is a more “plug and play” format with increased flexibility, designed for people who don't require quite as much structure, but respond well to guidelines.</p>
<p>The Summer Body Club creators understand that in order to achieve permanent weight loss and improved health, you must address three tenets of successful weight loss: nutrition, mindset, and highly efficient and effective exercise. That's why SBC delivers all three right to your inbox each day. On your journey toward achieving your own summer body, you'll have the opportunity to learn how your thoughts affect your eating behavior, and how to change your mindset so that your mind and body are working together.</p>
<p>When it comes to the food recommendations in SBC, you’ll never have to count a single calorie, and, instead, the focus is on “real foods”. You'll learn how to prepare simple, delicious, affordable recipes that are based on foods found in nature, not in boxes and cans or laden with chemicals. The meal plans are designed to be well-balanced, nutritionally dense and filling! </p>
<p>In the Summer Body Club, you'll discover a community of like-minded individuals who want to share and inspire each other. More than just a diet, this is a movement. <a href="">Are you ready to join?</a></p>

				<p><strong>Cynthia Pasquella</strong> is no stranger to the struggles with weight and health that millions of people deal with on a daily basis. Years ago, Cynthia reached a point where those very struggles had finally eclipsed everything else in her life, and she was left feeling broken and utterly hopeless. But Cynthia had an amazing epiphany that led her down a brand new path, one that transformed her from the inside out, and ultimately enabled her to help millions of others do the same. That epiphany was that she was meant for greatness. And she wholeheartedly believes that all everyone who feels just like she did, that they’re never enough, that they’re not worthy of anything good, are also meant for something really great.</p> 
				<p>Fast forward to today, and Cynthia is a certified clinical nutritionist (CCN), a bestselling author, the nutrition expert for hit shows like The Doctors, Dr. Phil and The Today Show, and the founder and director of the Institute of Transformational Nutrition, the only nutrition certification program that combines nutritional science, psychology, spirituality, and coaching skills to help people create permanent change in their health and life. Oh, and did we mention that she’s also a member of the National Association of Nutrition Professionals, the American Holistic Medical Association, the American Association of Nutritional Consultants, and The Center for Mindful Eating? And on the home front, she’s a wife and mom, so Cynthia certainly understands what it is to have a busy life!</p>
				<p>Cynthia’s holistic, transformational approach to weight loss and optimal health shines through in everything she does. She is famous for inspiring millions of women to discover what they’re really hungry for, so they can finally make peace with food and themselves. In fact, Cynthia is the host of the popular web video series, What You’re REALLY Hungry For, where she helps women discover the real reason they know what to do but still don’t do it so they can finally get the changes they want in their bodies and their lives. She is dedicated to helping empower women to live healthy, happy lives full of self-confidence and self-esteem knowing that nothing is impossible to achieve.</p>
