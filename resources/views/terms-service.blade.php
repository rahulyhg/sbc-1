			<p>15. General Provisions

<p><strong>ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW:</strong>
The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, or the Site shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against GMB in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction.  But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against GMB or its affiliates any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.</p>

<p>By using the GMB website or the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement.  In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and GMB or its affiliates (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court).  YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING.  Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.  You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.  The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.  Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. 
Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction.  In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against GMB (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Los Angeles County, California. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes and you irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury.</p>

<p>This Agreement, and any dispute between you and GMB, shall be governed by the laws of the state of California without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>

<p><strong>INTERPRETATION; SEVERABILITY; WAIVER; REMEDIES:</strong> Headings are for convenience only and shall not be used to construe the terms of this Agreement.  If any term of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be severed from this Agreement.  No failure or delay by GMB in exercising any right hereunder will waive any further exercise of that right.  GMB’s rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive.</p>

<p><strong>SUCCESSORS; ASSIGNMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES: </strong> This Agreement is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of both parties and their respective successors, heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, and permitted assigns.  You may not assign this Agreement without GMB’s prior written consent. No third party shall have any rights hereunder.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICES:</strong>You consent to receive all communications including notices, agreements, disclosures, or other information from GMB electronically.  GMB may provide all such communications by email or by posting them on the Summer Body Club Service.  For support-related inquiries, you may send an email to <a href="mailto:support@summerbodyclub.com">support@summerbodyclub.com</a> or the following address:<br>

Ghost Mountain Books, Inc.<br>

Los Angeles, CA 90004<br>

<p>Nothing herein shall limit GMB’s right to object to subpoenas, claims, or other demands.</p>

<p><strong>MODIFICATION:</strong> This Agreement may not be modified except by a revised Terms of Service posted by GMB on the GMB website or a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of GMB. A revised Terms of Service will be effective as of the date it is posted on the GMB website.</p>

<p><strong>ENTIRE AGREEMENT:</strong> This Agreement incorporates the following documents by reference:<br>
