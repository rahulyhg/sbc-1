					<h3>IMPULSE CONTROL:</h3>
					<h2>Interrupt the Impulse</h2>
					<img src="http://placehold.it/1000x400" class="img-responsive"><br><br>
					<p>
						Setting up conditions to delay your ability to perform the act immediately is the first part of improving impulse control. If the temptation is not readily at hand and takes extra effort to satisfy, the chances are much greater that you will be able to control the impulse.  Here are a few examples:
					</p> 
					
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">Remove snacks from your house when you go on a diet.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Throw away the cigarettes.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Remove bookmarks from your web browser so it takes more effort to go to your favorite distracting sites (Face Book, gamesâ€¦.).</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Lock up the video games.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Unplug the TV or just put the remote in a hard to reach spot.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Drive a different route to bypass the tempting store where you want to stop</li>
					</ul>
