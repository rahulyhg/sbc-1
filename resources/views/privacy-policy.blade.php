			<h2>Security </h2>
			<p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.</p>

			<p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.</p>

			<p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>

			
			<h2>Cookie Placement</h2>
			<p>Summerbodyclub.com, like many other commercial sites, may use a standard technology called “cookies” to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a website operator determine that a particular user had visited the site previously and thus save and remember your account information and any preferences that may have been set.  We may use cookies to keep track of information about your current web browsing session which will be discarded as soon as you log out or close your web browser.  This information also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose.  We may also make use of “persistent or memory based” cookies, which remain on your computer’s hard drive until you delete them. An example of our use of these cookies is to pre-populate forms you complete on our website based on information you have previously provided to us.  Although you have the ability to modify your browser to either accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize our services if you reject cookies.</p>
			
			<h2>Updates</h2>
			<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this page.</p>
